# Initial Project Plan and Structure v1

## Project Overview
**Objective**: Build a sleek, modern website (JesseAHawkins.com) to showcase AI projects with professional presentation and interactive demonstrations.

**Target Audience**: Potential employers, collaborators, clients, and AI enthusiasts interested in Jesse's work.

**Key Success Metrics**: 
- Professional appearance that reflects technical expertise
- Clear project demonstrations with interactive elements
- Fast loading times and smooth user experience
- Mobile-responsive design across all devices

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Framework
- **Primary**: React with modern hooks and functional components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first responsive design
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Deployment**: Static hosting (Vercel/Netlify) for optimal performance

### Component Architecture
- **Layout Components**: Header, Navigation, Footer, Sidebar
- **UI Components**: Buttons, Cards, Modals, Forms, Loading states
- **Project Components**: ProjectCard, ProjectDetail, DemoContainer, TechStack
- **Page Components**: Home, About, Projects, Contact, Blog

## Website Structure

### Core Pages
1. **Homepage** - Hero section, featured projects, brief bio, call-to-action
2. **Projects** - Comprehensive showcase with filtering and search
3. **About** - Detailed bio, skills, experience, and expertise
4. **Contact** - Professional contact form and social links
5. **Blog/Articles** (future) - AI insights and technical articles

### Navigation Flow
```
Homepage → Projects → Individual Project → Contact
    ↓
  About ← → Blog (future)
```

### Key Features
- **Project Showcase**: Interactive cards with hover effects and quick previews
- **Live Demos**: Embedded demonstrations of AI projects where possible
- **Technical Details**: Code snippets, architecture diagrams, tech stacks
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Performance Optimized**: Lazy loading, optimized images, efficient code

## Development Methodology

### Modular Development Approach
1. **Core Foundation**: Basic layout, navigation, and routing
2. **Component Library**: Reusable UI components and design system
3. **Content Integration**: Project data structure and management
4. **Interactive Features**: Demos, animations, and user interactions
5. **Optimization**: Performance, SEO, and accessibility improvements

### Artifact Creation Strategy
- **Small Modules**: Each component as separate artifact for easy management
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic functionality, add advanced features
- **Documentation**: Each artifact includes implementation notes and dependencies
- **Testing**: Sandbox testing for each component before integration

### Quality Assurance
- **Code Review**: Consistent coding standards and best practices
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge compatibility
- **Mobile Testing**: iOS and Android device testing
- **Performance Monitoring**: Core Web Vitals and loading speed optimization
- **Accessibility Audit**: WCAG compliance and screen reader testing

## Content Strategy

### Project Presentation Format
Each AI project will include:
- **Overview**: Brief description and key features
- **Technical Details**: Technologies used, architecture, challenges solved
- **Live Demo**: Interactive demonstration where applicable
- **Screenshots/Media**: Visual representation of the project
- **Source Code**: Links to GitHub repositories (if public)
- **Case Study**: Problem, solution, and results achieved

### Project Categories
- **Machine Learning Models**: Classification, regression, neural networks
- **Natural Language Processing**: Text analysis, chatbots, language models
- **Computer Vision**: Image recognition, object detection, video analysis
- **Data Analysis**: Visualization, insights, predictive analytics
- **AI Tools**: Utilities, frameworks, automation scripts

## Implementation Timeline
